# The Gallery
---

Objective:
---
For this project, it will mimic a real-life gallery. Guests will have the chance to view art pieces in the format of a carousel when they click the View All Artwork button. The art pieces will be displayed at random. No strict sequence will be followed to give the opportunity for artists to have their art seen by all. Each art piece will be providing the art piece name, the artist’s name, the art image itself (for now, only the file name of the art piece will be shown as the application has not been given the ability to show images), and a link to reveal the artist’s description of the art. The artist’s description will describe why the artist created their piece or if there is meaning behind it. This application is giving artists a simple way to reveal their work to the public. Artists will also have their own “Profile” that will display all their art work. Only registered users will have the ability to submit their own art work.

Motivation:
---
This application is created due to my love for art. Art, in my opinion, is subjective and should be enjoyed by everyone. There are no Likes/Dislikes buttons in order to keep the website friendly and relaxed. This website is hope to differentiate itself from others by being a simple website to broadcast art and hopefully keep artists from feeling some sort of competition among each other. 

Server-Side Components:
---
Storing components will be the following: the art files, artist's summary/description, and artist’s profile.

Future Goals:
---
Giving users the opportunity to add an art piece to their own favorite list. No art piece though will display how many people favorited their art piece. Another future additional will be letting registered users add their own opinions of the art piece, giving them the chance to express what they think the art piece is trying to convey. An instant messaging mechanism will be hopefully be added to let registered users communicate with one another. Images will be displayed in the future as well instead of only the file names. The last action will be allowing any registered user to have their own personal profiles to be displayed and have a tab to list all their art pieces.
