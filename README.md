# The Gallery
---

Objective:
---
For this project, a web page will give any registered user the ability to upload an art piece they have created to display on the main page. These art pieces will be distributed based on filters, either “Most Recent”, “Oldest”, or by “Random”. “Random” will be the default option view. The art pieces will be all displayed on the main page with the art piece title and creator's name.  The artist will also need to input a “Summary/Description” of their art piece, but this will be hidden from the other viewers by default. The "Reveal" feature will reveal the “Summary/Description”, providing the viewer with the choice to read the artist's description of their art piece. This application is giving artists a simple way to reveal their art to the public. Artists will also have their own “Profile” that will display all their art work. Viewers will be able to create their own accounts and have the ability to add their own description on the art piece under the "Guest Description" feature.

Motivation:
---
This is being created due to love of art. Art is subjective and should be shared by everyone. There will be no “Likes/Dislikes” option in order to encourage everyone to reveal their art work. By making the “Random” view the default option, this will give viewers a chance to be exposed to different types of creations. Many websites these days have search engines and a setting to give viewers similar content what they already like.

Server-Side Components:
---
Storing components will be the following: the art files, artist's summary/description, artist’s profile, and guest's description.
